## 1. Types
Every name(identifier) in a C++ program has a type associated with it. This type determines what operations can be applied to the name (that is, to the entity referred to by the name) and how such operations are interpreted. 

> For example;

```

float x; x is a floating-point variable*

int y = 7; y is an integer variable with the initial value 7*

float f(int); f is a function taking an argument of type int and returning a floating-point number*
